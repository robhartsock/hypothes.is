## Customise 

You’ll be able to easily tailor the design component as well as the type of news you want to see:

### Keyword
The search you want to make. E.g., “framer” will get news about Framer. You can leave it empty to get the latest news. For more documentation visit [newsapi.org/docs](https://newsapi.org/docs).

### Sources
The domain name of the news sources. For example framer.com or newyorker.com. You can have several by adding a comma in between each term – framer.com,nytimes.com,newyorker.com.

### # of articles
the number of articles you want to display in your stack.

### Gap
The distance between each article in the stack.

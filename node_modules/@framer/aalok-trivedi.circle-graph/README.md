**Note:** This is my first component, and I'm pretty new to react, so the code isn't the best and probably bloated. Sorry for any wonkiness that might occur!

### Known Issues

- When you change the radius of the circle, the stroke percentage becomes a little off. Just re-adjust the percentage after you adjust the radius and it should correct itself.
